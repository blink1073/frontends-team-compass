# JupyterLab

 - Even if you don't use Jupyter, you can still take this survey. Just indicate this fact in the first question 
   and carry on as best as you can.
 - Thank you. Your participation guides Jupyter's roadmap toward your real-life use cases by quantifiably 
   helping us prioritize the functionality that is important to our userbase. 
 - So that you know what to expect, it's comprised of 20 questions spread across the sections below. 
   As a fair heads up, Question 7  is the biggest one, but it provides critical information.
    - Usage patterns.
    - Data
    - Visualization.
    - Scale.
    - Collaboration.
 - The aggregate survey data itself will be openly shared with the Jupyter community when polling closes in mid-December.
